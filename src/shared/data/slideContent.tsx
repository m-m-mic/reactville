      We start our journey through ReactVille at <b>Router Road</b>, a quaint old town pedestrian area. From here on, you will
      have to decide how you want to progress.

      While making your decisions, always keep in mind what kind of application you want to build, as the complexity of what
      you’re working on greatly affects which folder structure will work best for your project.
      <div className="text-divider"></div>
      Up first: Does your application only need a <b>single view</b> to function, or are <b>multiple pages</b> with navigation
      required?

      A simple application requires less nesting, so you don’t have to worry about a huge folder structure, just leave the
      structure as it is. You should still be able to find your way around.

      In this case you will need a <b>router</b>, which helps you assign specific pages within your application to routes. The

      <b>components</b>?<div className="text-divider"></div>
      Components are what you need to build a user interface, they are bits of code that are independent and reusable, like
      buttons or search bars. Styling a component so that it fits your interface and then using it many times will give your
      project a consistent look and feel.

      With less than five components it’s best to keep them all in one <b>'components' folder</b>. That way you can find them
      easily.
      <div className="text-divider"></div>
      If you are working with unit tests, just name the test files the same way you named your components and add them to your
      'components' folder, don't bother with sub-folders.

      In each component folder you can then put all files related to said component, such as the main JSX file, styling, and unit
      tests. This helps with making the 'components' folder feel less cluttered, as you only ever have to open the component

      different component. A store helps you control state management from one central place that all parts of your application
      can access. This makes your code both more robust and more readable.
